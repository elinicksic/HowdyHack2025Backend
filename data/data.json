Opening (0-2s): quick neon title splash: \"Polyatomic ions — 12s cheat\". Scene 1 (2-5s): chem-nerd holds flashcards: show SO4²⁻ (emoji 💥) and says lines: \"Sulfate: SO four oxygens, -2 charge — think 'SO 4 two'\" with a goofy wink. Visual: animated 2⁻ popping next to formula. Skateboarder rolls by and does a tiny trick, knocks a flashcard that reveals NO3⁻. Scene 2 (5-8s): skeptic gasps, chem-nerd: \"Nitrate = NO3⁻, nitrite = NO2⁻ (one less O, same mood but less oxygen)\" Quick visual: compare NO3⁻ vs NO2⁻ with highlight. Scene 3 (8-11s): rapid 3-panel flash of common ions: CO3²⁻ (carbonate), PO4³⁻ (phosphate), NH4⁺ (ammonium), OH⁻ (hydroxide) — each with a one-word mnemonic under it (e.g., \"CO3: cake (2 layers)\" silly). Final beat (11-12s): punchline: skateboarder returns with a giant foam Periodic Table and says offscreen, \"Keep the charges, ditch the panic.\" Quick on-screen text: \"Save this 🎯\". Speaking outline: short punchy lines only; emphasize charges audibly (\"minus two\", \"plus one\"). Visuals: bold colored gradients, emoji overlays, quick formula animations, a tiny particle burst when charges appear. Make it unexpected and funny; skateboard cameo present but not main."

Cast: acid (character in red hoodie), base (character in blue cap), plus skateboarder crossing behind the scene at 4s doing a tiny ollie. Opening (0-2s): dramatic close-up on a droplet labeled H+. Scene 1 (2-6s): acid pours a tiny animated H+ into a cup, base throws an OH- like a confetti pop; they do a melodramatic handshake. Voice lines: Acid: \"I bring H+\", Base: \"I got OH-\". Scene 2 (6-9s): both gasp as H+ + OH- collide and create H2O — show a big water droplet animation and fireworks. Quick caption: \"Net ionic: H+ + OH- -> H2O\". Scene 3 (9-12s): cut to a table where spectator ions (Na+, Cl-) are chilling on the sidelines with sunglasses labeled 'spectators' — a tiny mic drop. End text: \"Salt + Water? Yeah. But net ionic = H2O.\" Speaking outline: emphasize the simplicity: \"H plus plus OH equals water\"; comedic pause for spectator ions.
