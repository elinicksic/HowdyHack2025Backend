Opening (0-2s): quick neon title splash: \"Polyatomic ions ‚Äî 12s cheat\". Scene 1 (2-5s): chem-nerd holds flashcards: show SO4¬≤‚Åª (emoji üí•) and says lines: \"Sulfate: SO four oxygens, -2 charge ‚Äî think 'SO 4 two'\" with a goofy wink. Visual: animated 2‚Åª popping next to formula. Skateboarder rolls by and does a tiny trick, knocks a flashcard that reveals NO3‚Åª. Scene 2 (5-8s): skeptic gasps, chem-nerd: \"Nitrate = NO3‚Åª, nitrite = NO2‚Åª (one less O, same mood but less oxygen)\" Quick visual: compare NO3‚Åª vs NO2‚Åª with highlight. Scene 3 (8-11s): rapid 3-panel flash of common ions: CO3¬≤‚Åª (carbonate), PO4¬≥‚Åª (phosphate), NH4‚Å∫ (ammonium), OH‚Åª (hydroxide) ‚Äî each with a one-word mnemonic under it (e.g., \"CO3: cake (2 layers)\" silly). Final beat (11-12s): punchline: skateboarder returns with a giant foam Periodic Table and says offscreen, \"Keep the charges, ditch the panic.\" Quick on-screen text: \"Save this üéØ\". Speaking outline: short punchy lines only; emphasize charges audibly (\"minus two\", \"plus one\"). Visuals: bold colored gradients, emoji overlays, quick formula animations, a tiny particle burst when charges appear. Make it unexpected and funny; skateboard cameo present but not main."
