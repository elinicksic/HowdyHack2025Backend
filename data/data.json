Scene 2 (2.5s): pour vinegar into cup, add baking soda — foam explodes theatrically, someone fake-panics and says 'we made salt, not chaos' — quick on-screen visual: chemistry equation HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H2O but keep text minimal. Scene 3 (3s): cut to cartoon-ish graphics: 'neutralization = salt + water' with quick icons (🧂💧). Scene 4 (3s): three quick examples pop up as flashes: vinegar+baking soda (acetic acid+carbonate), HCl+NaOH, lemon+antacid. Closing (1.5s): skateboarder rides away with goggles, voiceover: 'Balance those moles, not your vibes.' Visual notes: fast jump cuts, punchy music, exaggerated reactions, bright neon color grading, quick captions highlighting products (salt, water), final shot freeze-frame with confetti. Include a quick frame showing pH moving toward 7 (simple bar)."

Voiceover (sassy Gen-Z narrator): 'Less oxygen = incomplete, say hello to CO and soot.' Scene 2 (3s): split-screen: left full O2 flame (blue) -> CO2 + H2O; right limited O2 (yellow/orange smoke) -> CO + C (soot).
