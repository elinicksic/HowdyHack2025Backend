Scene 1 (3s): Show two burners side-by-side — left with a clean blue flame (complete), right with smoky yellow flame (incomplete). Voiceover: 'Blue flame = plenty O2 → CO2 + H2O. Yellow smoke = not enough O2 → CO, soot.' Add quick on-screen pop-ups: 'CO2 ✔️', 'CO ⚠️', 'soot = C'. Scene 2 (4s): Short comedic sketch: three characters — 'Fuel' (dude in leather), 'O2' (two dancers), and 'Exhaust' (a dramatic narrator). The dancers try to reach the fuel; if both are there, they cheer and produce CO2 confetti; if only one arrives, someone coughs (CO). Insert 0.5s skateboard cameo where a skateboarder rolls through carrying a CO detector that beeps. Scene 3 (3s): Quick practical visual: glowing buoyant flames vs smoky lamp flame next to carbon monoxide warning icon. Ending (1.5s): 'Complete = CO2 + H2O; Incomplete = CO, C, less energy' with hyperpop beat. Include captions: 'Balance O2 to avoid CO' and 'CO is toxic — ventilate'. Make it punchy, slightly absurd, and memorable."
