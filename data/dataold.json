Lil -ite: 'I lost one oxygen, still chill, same charge, smaller grill!' Include onscreen text: '‚Äîate = more O, same charge family'. 6-9s ‚Äî Unexpected visual: a dramatic slow-motion sprinkler drenches a giant plush 'O', with a skateboard briefly zooming through frame (not main focus). 9-11s ‚Äî Quick flashcards: NO3- (nitrate), NO2- (nitrite), ClO4- (perchlorate), ClO- (hypochlorite). 11-12s ‚Äî End slam: both characters high-five, text: 'Per- & Hypo- = extra / fewer O'. Spoken notes: be loud, snappy, playful trash-talk, one-liners that stick (e.g., 'More O = -ate flex', 'Less O = -ite chill'). Visual cues: bright stickers, emoji overlays, quick pop sound effects, captions for each ion. Keep tone irreverent, memorable, and weirdly educational."

Base: 'I take 'em like it's my job.' Overlay text: 'Br√∏nsted-Lowry'. 6-9s: They embrace; pop explosion of confetti (representing H+ + OH- -> H2O). Show salt (NaCl) as a tiny crown placed on a potato or plush toy. 9-11s: Quick aside: if carbonate present, show quick fizz and text 'CO2 gas!' 11-12s: Tagline: 'Neutralization = water + salt (and sometimes drama)'. Speaking outline: Use exaggerated melodrama for lines, quick comedic asides explaining proton transfer, and one line that says 'not every acid is strong ‚Äî some are just dramatic'.
