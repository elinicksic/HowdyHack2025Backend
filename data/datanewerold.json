Scene 1 (3s): Show two burners side-by-side — left with a clean blue flame (complete), right with smoky yellow flame (incomplete). Voiceover: 'Blue flame = plenty O2 → CO2 + H2O. Yellow smoke = not enough O2 → CO, soot.' Add quick on-screen pop-ups: 'CO2 ✔️', 'CO ⚠️', 'soot = C'. Scene 2 (4s): Short comedic sketch: three characters — 'Fuel' (dude in leather), 'O2' (two dancers), and 'Exhaust' (a dramatic narrator). The dancers try to reach the fuel; if both are there, they cheer and produce CO2 confetti; if only one arrives, someone coughs (CO). Insert 0.5s skateboard cameo where a skateboarder rolls through carrying a CO detector that beeps. Scene 3 (3s): Quick practical visual: glowing buoyant flames vs smoky lamp flame next to carbon monoxide warning icon. Ending (1.5s): 'Complete = CO2 + H2O; Incomplete = CO, C, less energy' with hyperpop beat. Include captions: 'Balance O2 to avoid CO' and 'CO is toxic — ventilate'. Make it punchy, slightly absurd, and memorable."

Actor B: 'Only the phase, baby.' Quick jump-cut (0.5s) to text overlay: ψ(t)=e^{-iHt/ħ}ψ(0). Scene 2 (3s): fast-motion skateboarder casually rolls through the frame carrying a glowing orb labeled 'ψ' while small animated waves ripple from the orb; voiceover: 'Unitary evolution = wiggle the phase, probabilities chill.' Scene 3 (4s): split-screen demo — left side shows a superposition interfering (bright color waves combining), right side shows an energy eigenstate whose shape stays same but color pulses (phase). Voiceover lines: 'Superpositions can change shape, eigenstates only change phase.' Final 2s: unexpected gag — a cartoon cat in lab goggles presses a big red 'MEASURE' button, everything freezes, then caption: 'Measurement = different rules.' End card with upbeat synth beat and text: 'Schrödinger, now with 100% more vibes.' Visuals: neon gradients, comic-style motion lines, quick subtitles for each spoken line, playful sound effects, skateboard cameo not central. Keep pacing jumpy and unpredictable, with one offbeat gag (cat + button)."

(2.5s) Visual demo (3s): animate a state vector rotating under Pauli X (flip), showing north ↔ south flip; overlay: 'σx = bit flip'. Quick captioned fact (1.5s): 'Opposite points = orthogonal states.' Final gag (1s): tiny cartoon pigeon perched on top of sphere, cheeping 'coherent? decohere', then freeze to end card. Include subtitles for accessibility, neon colors, and one brief skate cameo in background."

Scene 2 (3s): Show cartoon-ish pair of particles linked by a glowing tether; captions: 'Measure A -> B instantly correlated' (no text overlays with equations, keep visuals only). Voiceover B: 'Doesn't send messages, just spooky vibes.' Scene 3 (4s): Quick live-action prank-style bit: Person 1 flips a coin labeled |0> / |1>, Person 2's coin lights up simultaneously in matching state; comedic flinch reaction. Overlay small arrows showing measurement correlation. Scene 4 (2s): Quick callout: 'Bell tests > classical correlations' with simple bar-visual (no text heavy). End (1s): Punchline - two particles texting each other 'u up?' then fade to 'Not signalling, just correlated.' Audio: upbeat lo-fi beat, abrupt whoosh transitions, one comedic record-scratch when punchline hits. Speaking outline: 1) Hook: 'What if two particles are telepathic?' 2) Give short fact: 'Entanglement = measurement correlations stronger than classical' 3) Myth-bust: 'No faster-than-light messaging.' Visuals: split-screen humans, neon particle tether animation, coin/flip prop, skateboard briefly in frame, energetic quick cuts, bright pastel neon palette. Keep language snappy, meme-y, and playful."
