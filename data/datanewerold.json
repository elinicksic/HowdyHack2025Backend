Yellow smoke = not enough O2 ‚Üí CO, soot.' Add quick on-screen pop-ups: 'CO2 ‚úîÔ∏è', 'CO ‚ö†Ô∏è', 'soot = C'. Scene 2 (4s): Short comedic sketch: three characters ‚Äî 'Fuel' (dude in leather), 'O2' (two dancers), and 'Exhaust' (a dramatic narrator). The dancers try to reach the fuel; if both are there, they cheer and produce CO2 confetti; if only one arrives, someone coughs (CO). Insert 0.5s skateboard cameo where a skateboarder rolls through carrying a CO detector that beeps. Scene 3 (3s): Quick practical visual: glowing buoyant flames vs smoky lamp flame next to carbon monoxide warning icon. Ending (1.5s): 'Complete = CO2 + H2O; Incomplete = CO, C, less energy' with hyperpop beat. Include captions: 'Balance O2 to avoid CO' and 'CO is toxic ‚Äî ventilate'. Make it punchy, slightly absurd, and memorable."

Scene 2 (3s): Show cartoon-ish pair of particles linked by a glowing tether; captions: 'Measure A -> B instantly correlated' (no text overlays with equations, keep visuals only). Voiceover B: 'Doesn't send messages, just spooky vibes.' Scene 3 (4s): Quick live-action prank-style bit: Person 1 flips a coin labeled |0> / |1>, Person 2's coin lights up simultaneously in matching state; comedic flinch reaction. Overlay small arrows showing measurement correlation. Scene 4 (2s): Quick callout: 'Bell tests > classical correlations' with simple bar-visual (no text heavy). End (1s): Punchline - two particles texting each other 'u up?' then fade to 'Not signalling, just correlated.' Audio: upbeat lo-fi beat, abrupt whoosh transitions, one comedic record-scratch when punchline hits. Speaking outline: 1) Hook: 'What if two particles are telepathic?' 2) Give short fact: 'Entanglement = measurement correlations stronger than classical' 3) Myth-bust: 'No faster-than-light messaging.' Visuals: split-screen humans, neon particle tether animation, coin/flip prop, skateboard briefly in frame, energetic quick cuts, bright pastel neon palette. Keep language snappy, meme-y, and playful."
